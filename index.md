## Course Overview

<blockquote>
In this course, students will learn the methodology behind experimental research in computer science. The course will cover topics such as planning a new research project, designing experiments, enabling repeatable research, and effectively presenting your results. It will also provide practice with the four skills critical to being an effective researcher: reading, writing, speaking, and thinking creatively.

*Registration is restricted to CS Ph.D. students*, but some masters or undergraduate students actively engaged in a research project may be allowed to take the course with the approval of their research advisor and the instructor. Students *must* already be involved in a research project before the start of the course.  *New Ph.D. students are particularly encouraged to take the course.* Ph.D. students from related disciplines such as ECE may be considered if space allows.
